## About this Workshop
Welcome to our hands-on workshop on Git Internals! This workshop is designed to give you a deep dive into the workings of the `.git` folder, helping you understand the core concepts of Git, including blobs, trees, commits, and branches. Whether you're new to Git or an experienced user, this workshop will provide valuable insights into the mechanisms that power Git.

## The Goal of this workshop
We are going to make a barebone git repository completely manually from scratch without using any typical `git init`. Doing this will provide us deeper understanding of how git actually works.

### Navigation
- Use the sidebar/menu to navigate between different sections of the workshop.
- Sections are organized in the order they should be completed.

### Working Through the Workshop
- **At Your Own Pace**: The content is structured to allow you to work at a pace that's comfortable for you.
- **Hands-on Practice**: Each section includes practical tasks to apply what you've learned.
- **Self-Guided Learning**: The workshop is designed for self-guided learning with comprehensive instructions.

## Let's Get Ready!
We are excited to have you here and can't wait to explore the intricacies of Git with you.

For this workshop you are going to need to have a git installed! I will recommend everyone to use terminal (OSX/unix) or Git Bash (windows).

[Setup Your Git enviroment](pages/git-setup.md) 

For Mac and Linux users, installing the tree command in your terminal is recommended. Windows users can achieve a similar tree structure output by using the command `cmd //C "tree .git /F /A"`in git-bash. Make sure to have this command handy, as we'll need to display the tree structure later in the workshop.

## Let's Get Started!
When your setup is verified and ready, lets go to the first section:[ Create .git.](pages/1-git-folder.md)
