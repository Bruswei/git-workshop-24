## About this Workshop
Welcome to our hands-on workshop on Git Internals! This workshop is designed to give you a deep dive into the workings of the `.git` folder, helping you understand the core concepts of Git, including blobs, trees, commits, and branches. Whether you're new to Git or an experienced user, this workshop will provide valuable insights into the mechanisms that power Git.

## The Goal of this workshop
We are going to make a barebone git repository completely manually from scratch without using any typical `git init`. Doing this will provide us deeper understanding of how git actually works.
